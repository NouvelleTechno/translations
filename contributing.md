# Contributing to translations

Thank you for your interest in helping the internationalisation of QuizBot, PollBot Advanced and our base bot system.

## Before translating

Please join our [Discord server](https://www.ihxyz.dev/bots/support) and talk to a developer before beginning the translation. If we're fine for you to add translations we will add the base files for that language with placeholder English text and let you know when you can begin translating.

## Translation files

All our translation files are .yml files. These files may require a [special program](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or app to be edited or viewed. Alternatively you can also edit the files straight on GitHub which is able to natively support .yml files.

## Where to begin

There is a lot of text in our bots. We understand that you might not have time to translate all of it.

If you only have time to translate a bit of the bot, we would recommend you start with the text under the SESSIONS subheading. This is relevant to playing quizzes and is the most important function of QuizBot. If this is already completed then you can take a look at the "base" text as this is especially important for the entire command system.

## After translating

Once you have finished translating, please contact the developers on our support server and we will assist you in adding the translations to this project.
