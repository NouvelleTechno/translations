# ihxyz bot translation

All bot translations are split into three different sections.

First is the "base command system". These are all the messages that are re-used across all bots, 
and only need to be translated once to be used across all. Some examples include the 
"permission denied" and "something went wrong" messages. 

Next are the "QuizBot" messages: messages that are only used in QuizBot, and then the 
"PollBot Advanced" messages: messages that are only used in PollBot Advanced.
